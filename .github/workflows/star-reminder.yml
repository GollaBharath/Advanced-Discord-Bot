    steps be undefined. This causes the action to receive:
      - name: Post a friendly reminder to star the repo on issues
        if: github.event_name an invalid `issue-number`.

**Solution:**
Update the ` == 'issues'
        uses: peter-evans/create-or-updateissue-number` input to use a conditional expression that selects the appropriate number based on-comment@v4
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.G the event typeITHUB_TOKEN }}
          issue-number: ${{ github.event.issue.number }}
          body: |
            ## ðŸŒŸ. Hereâ€™s a corrected version:

```yaml
issue-number: $ Thank you for contributing!
            ...
      - name: Post a friendly reminder to star the repo on PR{{ github.event.issue.number != null && github.event.issues
        if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
       .number || github.event.pull_request.number }}
